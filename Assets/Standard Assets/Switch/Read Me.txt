Switch
=======

Thank you for using Switch. This package gives you advanced 
trigger functionality which allows you to create a great deal 
of game mechanics without touching any code.

Current version: 1.0
Supports: Unity 4.3


Instructions
=============
1. Drag the SwitchTrigger script onto a GameObject.
2. Configure the trigger's options
	- Choose which tag can activate the trigger
	- Choose how the trigger is activated
	- Choose whether the trigger can be activated more than once
	- (optional) Choose if you want a delay before the trigger does something
	- (optional) Choose another trigger to affect once this one has activated
3. Configure actions
	- Select a target GameObject you would like to perform an action on
	- (optional) Choose a component (script, light, camera, etc) from the 
	  GameObject to affect instead of the GameObject itself
	- Choose an action for the trigger to perform
	- Configure extra options some actions require

A single trigger can have as many actions as you'd like. 
You can drag multiple SwitchTrigger scripts onto a GameObject.


Usage
======
- Enabling/Disabling Components and GameObjects
- Destroying Components and GameObjects
- Spawning prefabs and GameObjects at a spawn point
- Calling public functions on Components and Monobehaviours
- Playing, stopping, pausing, resuming, and speeding up animations
- Playing sounds


Demo
=====
There is a Demo scene included with Switch. It demonstrates basic functionality 
with each use case. However, triggers can be linked together to create fairly 
robust systems.


Notes
=============
-- Call Function --
Please keep in mind that when using the "Call Function" action you should avoid
renaming the selected function as it will break the reference in the trigger(s). 
If we can find a good solution to avoid this, we will release an update.

-- Button Press --
The object permitted to activate the trigger must be touching the trigger's 
collider when pressing the button.

-- Animations --
If you are using a trigger to loop an animation, ensure the animation 
asset has its 'Wrap Mode' set to 'Loop' to prevent a delay.
